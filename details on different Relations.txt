This Program Helps in Checking the type of the  relation
1. Identiy Relation
2. Reflexive Relation
3. Symmetric Relation
4. Transitive Relation
5. Equivalence Relation

Explaintion..

Identiy Relation ->

on a set 
let the set be A = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Cardinality(Number of elements in Set A) : 4
A * A(A cross A) ={ (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(1,4),
					(2,2),(2,1),(2,3),(2,4),
					(3,3),(3,1),(3,2),(3,4),
					(4,4)(4,1),(4,2),(4,3) }

now if relation given contiains all the elements related to itself only than the relation in Identity Relation
According to the Example
Identiy Relation on A = {(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)}


Reflexive Relation ->

Now to continue taking the above Example i.e of set A = {1,2,3,4}
now if the relation contains all the elements related to itself than the relation is Reflexive Relation
Example :-
Reflexive Relation in set A = {(1,1),(2,2),(3,3),(4,4),(1,3),(3,4)}


Important Part:-
Some people have problem in understanding Identity Relation and Reflexive Relation.
the main difference between them is that there can be only 1 Identity Relation in any set

i.e Identity Relation can be a Reflexive relation by Reflexive Relation cannot be a Identity Relaion all time...


Symmetric Relation ->

now it the relation have all element i.e (a,b) and (b,a)
Proper Representation..
(a,b) belong R -> (b,a) belongs R for all a, b in set given

Example :-
Symmetric Relation in set A = {(1,2),(2,1),(3,4),(4,3)}


Transitive Relation ->

(a,b) belong R and (b,c) belongs R -> (a,c) belongs R for all a, b, c belongs to the given set 
accordingly.

Example :-
Symmetric Relation in set A = {(1,2),(2,1),(1,1),(3,4),(4,3),(3,3)}


Equivalence Relation -> 

If the Relation is  reflexive , symmetic and transitive at a time than the relation is Equivalence Relation.

Example:
{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (4,4)}
